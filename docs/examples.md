The `packages/troika-examples` directory contains several example scenes. These are intended to demonstrate a wide range of Troika's capabilities and some interesting techniques that it enables.


## Viewing the examples

The examples are not yet published to a public website yet; we hope to get that working soon. In the meantime...


## Running the examples

You can run the examples yourself from the source code. First check out the source from GitHub and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/protectwise/troika.git
cd troika
npm install
```

Then run the examples:

```
npm run examples
```

This will build the examples into a bundle and serve up the result at [http://localhost:10001]. Point your browser there and you'll see the examples in action.
