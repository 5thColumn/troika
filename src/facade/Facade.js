/**
 * The base class for all Facade classes.
 *
 * A Facade is basically just a class that receives property assignments from a scene descriptor
 * and manages forwarding the resulting state to more complex underlying implementation
 * objects, e.g. ThreeJS objects.
 *
 * The instantiated facade objects have a very simple lifecycle:
 *   - The `constructor` in which the initial state and the underyling implementation object(s)
 *     can be initialized. It will be passed a single argument: the `parent` facade object.
 *   - Updates to the object's properties, usually by direct assignment from the scene descriptor.
 *     These updates can be handled immediately by defining property setters that handle syncing
 *     new values to the underyling implementation object(s).
 *   - The `afterUpdate()` method which signals the end of all property updates; this can be
 *     implemented to handle syncing the full set of updated properties to the underlying
 *     implementation object(s). Useful if an aspect of the syncing relies on multiple properties
 *     or needs things to be synced in a specific order.
 *   - The `destructor` method which is always called when the object is removed from the scene.
 *     Implement this to remove and clean up the underlying implementation object(s) and other
 *     cleanup logic.
 *
 * Scene Descriptors:
 *
 * All facade instances are created, updated, and destroyed based on the current structure of
 * a scene descriptor object. The properties in the descriptor are generally just copied
 * directly to properties of the same names on the facade instance, which can handle them
 * either by custom setters or in `afterUpdate`. There are a few special properties in the
 * descriptor:
 *
 *   - `facade`: (required) a reference to the Facade class that will be instantiated.
 *   - `key`: (optional) an identifier that is unique amongst the descriptor's siblings, which
 *     is used to associate the descriptor with its corresponding Facade instance. One will be
 *     assigned automatically if omitted, but it's preferable that you set one manually to ensure
 *     descriptors are predictably resolved to the same facade instances when siblings are being
 *     added or removed.
 *   - `children`: (optional) for `Parent` facade subclasses, defines the child object descriptors.
 *   - `ref`: (optional) a function that will be called with a reference to the instantiated Facade
 *     on creation, and with `null` on destruction, allowing external code to maintain references
 *     to individual facades.
 *   - `transition`: (optional) defines a set of properties that should be transitioned smoothly
 *     when their value changes. See `Animatable` for more details.
 *   - `animation`: (optional) defines one or more keyframe animations. See `Animatable` for more details.
 *   - `exitAnimation`: (optional) defines a keyframe animation to run when the facade is removed from its parent.
 *
 * It is also possible to define facade descriptors using JSX (https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html),
 * if it is precompiled to `React.createElement` calls. In this case, use the facade class as the JSX
 * element name instead of a `facade` property, and child descriptors are defined as nested JSX elements i
 * nstead of a `children` property. *NOTE:* While this is often a nicer looking syntax than the plain JS object
 * form, be aware that the creation of JSX elements does carry a slight performance cost from extra logic
 * and object allocations, so you should avoid it when defining large numbers of facades or when updating
 * descriptors on every frame.
